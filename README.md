# Custom Multicasting Library
This is a project for the course [Computer Networks (COMP 535)](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2023-2024/courses/comp-535) at McGill Univeristy, Montreal. It implements a simple multicasting service using UDP and it defines a simple API for services and application to use. It follows a Zero Configuration Service (ZCS) model, where services can be discovered and used by applications without any configuration.
