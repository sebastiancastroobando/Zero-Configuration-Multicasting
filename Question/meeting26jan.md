# Q1:
Are the containers considered as separate nodes where each one can be either a service or an application?
Our implementation should consider cases of a network with 1 to MAX_NODES number of nodes? In the handout it says
that there will be a maximum of 10 nodes, is that correct?
# Q2:
Are the port numbers static between services and applications (only two port numbers, port x for services and port y for apps)?
